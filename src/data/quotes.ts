/*
 * Background live-quote store.
 *
 * Holds the latest per-symbol quote from the live feed (the Massive REST
 * snapshot poller, or a WS push after an upgrade) in a process-singleton
 * solid-store, and keeps the "watchlist" subscription registered for the
 * active list's symbols whether or not the watchlist panel is mounted.
 *
 * Why this lives outside the Watchlist component: the panel unmounts when the
 * rail tab closes (RightRail uses <Show>). Previously the live state, the
 * `trade-tick` listener, and the subscription all lived in the component, so
 * closing the panel cleared the subscription (background updates stopped) and
 * dropped the cached quotes (a refetch flash on reopen). Hoisting them here
 * makes the feed run for the app's lifetime: the panel just reads this store,
 * so reopening shows the current prices instantly and they never stop ticking.
