/*
 * DataProvider — the provider-agnostic data seam.
 *
 * Everything the app needs from a market-data vendor is expressed here as a set
 * of capability traits (history / reference / realtime). The Tauri commands and
 * the live-data task talk to a `Provider` (a boxed trait object) instead of
 * calling Massive directly, so swapping vendors is one new impl + one match arm
 * in `build()` — no command or frontend change.
 *
 * The frontend contract is unaffected: providers return the shared
 * `crate::data::types`, which are the same structs already exported to
 * `bindings.ts`, so the TypeScript side never learns which vendor served a call.
 *
 * Date math (trading calendar, scroll-back `before_sec` → range conversion) and
 * the process/disk caches stay in the command + impl layers; the trait surface
 * is intentionally just ranged fetches and reference lookups.
